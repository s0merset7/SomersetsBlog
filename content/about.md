Hello! I'm Somerset, a Computer Systems Engineering major at Arizona State University with a concentration in Cybersecurity. I am still getting my bearings in the field but I'm starting to take a liking to pentesting and more red team aspects. I learned a lot from my time at NaviSec [NaviSec](https://navisec.io/) as an intern where I learned about professional pentesting and vulnerability assessments. My mentor at NaviSec ([@pry0cc](https://twitter.com/pry0cc)) encouraged me to learn by doing retired [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) machines which recently has been my main focus along with preparing for my new upcoming internship.

In my free time I enjoy movies, especially anything mystery thriller related (as you may have figured out with my name). I also leave the house occasionally to go hiking in the beautiful Phoenix area.
