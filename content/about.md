Hello! I'm s0merset7, a recent university graduate with a degree in cybersecurity. While I'm still getting my bearings in the field, I'm learning as much as I can with whatever I can get my hands on. I have a couple of internships under my belt where I have learned a lot about pentesting and vulnerability assessments and an upcoming full time position.

As of now my interests lay in the offensive security and OSINT fields but I hope to continue exploring all cybersecurity fields to find my true passion. 

In my free time I enjoy movies (especially mystery thriller), hiking, camping, online cybersecurity challenges, and competing in CTFs.
