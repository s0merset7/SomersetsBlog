Hello! I'm s0merset7, a cybersecurity professional. I'm still getting my bearings in the field, but as I learn more I present at conferences around the world trying to share my passion and knowledge for everything cybersecurity related. I've learned a lot but still love to take in whatever I can get my hands on.

As of now my interests lay in offensive security, OSINT, and investigatory fields, but I hope to continue exploring all cybersecurity sectors to find my true passion. 

In my free time I enjoy movies (especially mystery thriller), hiking, camping, online cybersecurity challenges, and competing in CTFs.
